# Ktor-Talk-Gradle

## Building a web microservice using Kotlin and Ktor

This is the companion sourcecode for my talk given at S2 Tech Offsite in Novemer 2017 which can be found here: https://www.slideshare.net/MarcusKida/building-a-web-microservice-using-kotlin-and-ktor

To run this project please create a new application configuration with `io.kida.ktortalk.AppKt` as the main class.
